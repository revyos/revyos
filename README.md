# RevyOS

## Introduction

[RevyOS](https://github.com/revyos)  is a custom Debian distribution optimized for the T-Head chip ecosystem, supported and developed by the RevyOS team from the [Ruyi SDK](https://github.com/ruyisdk) team.

RevyOS provides comprehensive adaptation and optimization support for chips such as c906fdv, c910v, and c908. By default, it integrates support for the RVV0.7.1 and XThead GCC toolchains. Furthermore, it is equipped with glibc and kernel optimized for the RVV0.7.1 instruction set.

Currently, RevyOS meets basic user needs in areas like office tasks, web browsing, and video playback.

Thanks to its customizations and optimizations, RevyOS offers superior performance and an excellent experience on hardware platforms like Lichee RV and Lichee Pi 4A.
